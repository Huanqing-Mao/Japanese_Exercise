# H/K_Exercise
# Hello there to Japanese Beginners who are struggling to find a platform to practise Hiragana and Katakana! 
# These are the source codes for a random romaji generator, which generates a customised number of sets of romaji
# upon which you can write down the corresponding Hiragana/Katakana scripts on paper by memory to test your memorisation! 

# I have provided the commands in the commands.txt file, where you can copy paste the commands on your terminal to make it work!

# Enjoy learning Japanese :)
